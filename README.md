# Implementation of various RL algorithms only for mastering these concepts.

Some of these algorithms are exact copy of other sources (books, Medium, Towardsdatascience, ...)

01. Optimal Policy Search: 

02. Temporal-Difference Predicition:
This code is the exact implementation of the Medium article titled: "[Reinforcement Learning in Python, Temporal-Difference Predicition](https://medium.com/reinforcement-learning-in-python-temporal/reinforcement-learning-in-python-temporal-difference-prediction-5b3b4e46f22f)" by [James Mukuya](https://medium.com/@james.mukuya).
