# Implementation of various RL algorithms only for mastering these concepts.

Some of these algorithms are exact copy of other sources (books, Medium, Towardsdatascience, ...)

01. Optimal Policy Search: 

02. Temporal-Difference Predicition:
This code is the exact implementation of the Medium article titled: "Reinforcement Learning in Python, Temporal-Difference Predicition" by James Mukuya. The URL of the article is as follows:
