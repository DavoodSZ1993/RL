## Implementation of various RL algorithms only for mastering these concepts.

Some of these algorithms are exact copy of other sources (books, Medium, Towardsdatascience, ...)

#### 01. Optimal Policy Search: 
This code is from the Medium article titled: "[Reinforcement Learning, Part 4: Optimal Policy Search with MDP](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/reinforcement-learning-part-4-optimal-policy-search-with-mdp-7fc96158ea8a)" written by [Dan Lee](https://medium.com/@Adline125)

#### 02. Temporal-Difference Predicition:
This code is the exact implementation of the Medium article titled: "[Reinforcement Learning in Python, Temporal-Difference Predicition](https://medium.com/reinforcement-learning-in-python-temporal/reinforcement-learning-in-python-temporal-difference-prediction-5b3b4e46f22f)" by [James Mukuya](https://medium.com/@james.mukuya).
